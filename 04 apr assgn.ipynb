    "The decision tree classifier is a machine learning algorithm that predicts the value of a target variable by learning decision rules from a set of input features. The algorithm creates a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, with the root node being the starting point of the tree, and each subsequent node being a decision based on one of the input features."

    "Split the data: The algorithm splits the data based on the chosen feature and creates two or more child nodes, each representing a subset of the data. The splitting process continues recursively until all the data is classified into homogeneous groups.\n",
